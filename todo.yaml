reconsider:
  Gore_:
    - '1218'        # These coins are being spewed by the goomba pet.
                    # Maybe make them more related to the goomber?
  Item_:
    - '7/10'        # Iron hammer/axe. They look really similar.
    - '31'          # Bottle. Didn't like how this one turned out.
    - '2348'        # Potion. Not sure how to feel about the design.
  NPC_:
    - '16'          # Mother slime. Don't like how the bottom turned out.
    - '48'          # Harpy. Outdated sans design + p sure i could do a better blaster now + L + Ratio
    - '121'         # Slimer. Wing animation sucks.
    - '134'         # Destroyer head. Glowy flower isn't represnting the SOUL colors correctly.
    - '458'         # Eternia Crystal. Sprite feels like it needs a couple tweaks.
  UI/Cursor_:
    - '3'           # Star cursor. Looks weird.

text placeholders:
  format: '#( placeholder : { name } )[,{ aliases }]'
  where:
    name: The placeholder.
    aliases: Pipe-separated list of aliases.
  example: '#( placeholder : jungle ),Jungle | Sansgle'
  items:
    - don't starve
    - mushroom biome
    - jungle
    - plantera

other:
  - Hallow splash still depicts card kingdom instead of cyber world.
  - >
    Considering the Hallow's current lore, it'd make more sense to make
    EoL based on deltarune instead of just being a 7-souled sans.
  - >
    Create a world specifically for testing Resource Packs.
    Builder's workshop just doesn't cut it sometimes :(
