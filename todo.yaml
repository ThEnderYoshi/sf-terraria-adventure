reconsider:
  Gore_:

music notes:

text placeholders:

other:
  - Hallow splash still depicts card kingdom instead of cyber world.
  - >
    Considering the Hallow's current lore, it'd make more sense to make
    EoL based on deltarune instead of just being a 7-souled sans.
  - >
    Create a world specifically for testing Resource Packs.
    Builder's workshop just doesn't cut it sometimes :(
