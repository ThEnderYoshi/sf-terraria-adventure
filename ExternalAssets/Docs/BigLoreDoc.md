# The Big Lore Document

SFTA brings a lot of lore to _Sans Fanfic_.
While some of it is exclusive to SFTA, most of it is indeed canon.

This document moslty shows of the lore that couldn't be added in the
localization files or expands on it.

## Biomes

### The Sansface

> Replaces Forest/Purity biome.

The surface of [ B I G   S A N S ].
Known for having a large amount of [Bad Thyme].

### The Snans/Con*sans*trate

> Replaces Snow/Ice biomes.

A region highly dense in sans and sansnergies (sans energies).
So dense in fact, that several of its inhabitants - especially its
[guardian](#sanstrocity-prime) - are composed of multiple fused Sanses.

Such high density would have caused the consanstrate
to have violently burst long ago
if it wasn't for its surface shell, the Snans biome.

It is a very thick layer of snans (snow sans),
made of the frigid dust of hundreds of thousands of
[Titan Sanses](#titan-sanses).

### Toriel's House

> Replaces Jungle/Underground Jungle biomes.

Every version of Sans Fanfic needs its version of Toriel's House.
In this case, it takes form of a massive blister worming its way across
the [ B I G   S A N S ].

Specifically, the House's wallpaper is an aggressive species of Mold called
Wallpaper Mold.
This mold is known to cause serious infections, to the point of serious physical
alterations and the host loosing control of their own body.

Toriel's House also features several "Spawners": structures made of blue
metallic mesh, ranging in size to 4' cubes to giant hive-like structures.
It appears the Spawners are malfunctioning, as the only thing they produce is
battery acid that pools at the bottom of these structures.

The Wallpaper Mold and Battey Acid also have an
[interesting reaction together](#gohst-sauce).

### No San's Land

> Replaces the Crimson biome.

The Sans No Man's Land, this battlefileld is where the Sanses and
Loogies duke it out fo find out whos strongest.

The ground takes shape as a deeply damaged part of [ B I G   S A N S ],
with all the ash and soot making it dark gray,
and all the impacts and explosions leaving it cracked and almost toothless.

This place is known as one of the largest deposits of Sansnium,
mainly because everywhere else has already been hollowed out,
and _no one_ has the time to mine ores in a warzone.

Its underground section houses [Sevenbones].

### Gamestop

> Replaces the Dungeon.

So the books are replaced by Copies of _UNDERTALE_.
It only follows that the Dungeon, a place with lots of books,
would be some kind of game store.

**BONUS FUN FACT:** Spell Tomes are replaced by Copies of _DELTARUNE_,
even though, at the time of writing this,
no physical copies of _DELTARUNE_ exist.

### The Undersans

> Replaces the Underworld

This place, as the name suggests,
actually exists _under_ the [ B I G   S A N S ].

The [Wall of Bone] serves as its guardian,
keeping the Dark World from _DELTARUNE_ trapped down there.
Killing WoB will release the Dark World onto the [Sansface].

### The Dark World

> Replaces the Hallow.

Unleashed after WoB's defeat.

This isn't the only place _DELTARUNE_'s inhabitants have gone to.
Some, like Nubert, have absorbed some of the background
Sansnergies (Sans energies), becoming Sansified.

## Town NPCs

As you'd expect they are mostly Sanses, each from a different AU.
They have taken refuge in _Sans Fanfic_ after their worlds were destroyed.

### Punished!Loogie

> Replaces the Tavernkeep

_Luigi Fanfic_ featrues a forbidden zone known as the Timeout Corner.
If you go there (like this Loogie did) you get branded.

However, being branded is illegal, so he had to escape to _Sans Fanfic_.

Betrayed by his bretheren, Punished!Loogie now aids you in defeating the
Mushroom Army, who's looking for him - and you!

### Nerd!Lnik

> Replaces the Goblin Tinkerer

Lniks are an odd and mysterious bunch.
Not much is known about them, but this one clearly resents his kin.
He calls them things like "Jock Lniks".

All that is really known about them is that they joined forces
with the loogies soley because they're both green. \
Even though most Lniks aren't green. \
Huh.

## Threats

### King Slans

> Replaces King Slime.
>
> _"Imma getcha!" &horbar; King Slans_

The largest recorded slans (slime sans),
he has ninja duplication abilities.

### Eye of Sans

> Replaces Eye of Cthulhu.
>
> _"So it begins."_

Back in the Old Ages, gigantic beings known as
[Titan!Sanses](#titan-sanses) roamed the land.
For unknown reasons, they are now gone,
but their remains can be seen across the Sansd (Sans land).

If one of them were to have their glowing eye removed,
it would come to life, flying around and epically trolling n00bs.

### Biggler of Wigglers

> Replaces Eater of Worlds.
>
> _"Booty blasted"_

Some poor worms that have been affected by the Luigification process,
becoming strange, leg-less Wigglers.

It seems size doesn't matter for them to be affected,
but the bigger the worm, the angrier it gets!

### Sevenbones

> Replaces Brain of Cthulhu.
>
> _"Out of sight, out of mind."_

Formally called :bone::bone::bone::bone::bone::bone::bone:.

During one of the more tense moments in the war,
a Sixbones was unleashed, wreaking havoc on the Loogies.
However, it merged with one of its targets,
causing it to start attacking both sides.

As a last resort,
the being now known as Sevenbones was sealed underground.

Its 2 halves **hate** eachother,
so Sevenbones keeps trying to attack itself.

### MOTHERSPAWNER

> Replaces Queen Bee.
>
> _"my child you are breaking my heart"_

A large Gohst resembling a Toriel created from a specific flavor of
[Gohst Sauce].

MOTHERSPAWNERS are highly territorial and will fiercely guard the Spawners they
were born in - _especially_ their Successors.

These gohsts begin their lives in coocoon-like structures. Once hatched, the
new gohst will feed on the body of the previous MOTHERSPAWNER, who does not even
fight back. This dynamic of overtaking grants these larval MOTHERSPAWNERS the
name of "successors".

Destroying a successor will enrage the currently standing MOTHERSPAWNER and
cause it to attack the intruder. (you)

### Papytron

> Replaces Skeletron.
>
> _"NYEH HEH HEH!" &horbar; Papyrus_

**Of course** the skeleton boss is replaced by ~~Sans~~
_THE GREAT PAPYRUS!_

He knows a Human (a Gamer, no doubt) will eventually try to enter [Gamestop],
so he stationed himself there, waiting patiently.

### Sanstrocity Prime

> Replaces Deerclops
>
> _"EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH" &horbar; EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH_
> _&horbar; EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH_
> _&horbar; EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH_
> _&horbar; EHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEH_

When arriving in the world of _Sans Fanfic_,
the Sanstrocity from _HELP\_TALE_ found refuge in the [Consanstrate],
with its environment being so similar to the amagalm.

Spending time in the dense sansnergies (sans energies) of the biome,
it grew more powerful and even sansier,
becoming the horrific abomination we all know and love today!

### Wall of Bone

> Replaces Wall of Flesh.
>
> _"It's gone for good. Good heavens, what did you DO?"_

A massive wall made of bones, it is the guardian of The Undersans.
Its job is to keep _DELTARUNE_ sealed away.

### Emperor Slans

> Replaces Queen Slime.
>
> _"Imma getcha this time!" &horbar; Emperor Slans_

Remember how [King Slans] is the largest _recorded_ slans?
Well, this one is _even bigger_.

And if that wasn't bad enough,
he has absorbed some of the newly-released Dark, Darker, Yet Darker energies,
granting him _super_ ninja duplication abilities!

### Soogi Mechs

> Replaces the mech bosses.
>
> _"The rare instance of them working together. This is your fault."_

Both the Sanses and Loogies have figured out your goal:
to defeat the [ B I G   S A N S ]'s SOUL. This would completely invalidate their
existences, so they have joined forces in order to stop you. The result is the
newly-invented Soogi (sans loogie) alloy, and the mechanical terrors made
from it.

They are:

- **The Twans**

  > Replaces The Twins

  Mechanically enhanced Eyes of Sans from a SwapTitan!Sans and a FellTitan!Sans.

- **Papytron Paprime**

  > Replaces Skeletron Prime.

  Modelled after some of the Underground's strongest monsters,
  this enormous mech and its pilot are out for blood.

- **Bigglest of Wigglers**

  > Replaces Destroyer.

  Built in the image of BoW,
  after the Loogies saw its effectiveness at destroying targets.

  Its many cores were built by the Sanses,
  made to seek and destroy any foe that BoW2 failed to ram into.

### ~~Emperor of Sansperor~~

> ~~Replaces Empress of Light.~~

While this boss is the one currently replacing EoL,
it will itself be replaced by a more lore-accurate foe.

### [ B I G   S A N S ] SOUL

> Replaces Moon Lord.
>
> _"You have freed yourself, but a what cost?"_

The very essence of the [ B I G   S A N S ],
he represents every iteration of Sans in every AU,
as well as the _UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE_ fandoms.

Being final boss, defeating him will finally free you from this hell.
However, doing so will also cause your [ B I G   S A N S ] to slowly die out,
as it cannot live without a SOUL.

As it dies, _all_ other Sanses begin to lose their powers and knowlege,
causing them to become normal monsters and undoing the entirety of Undertale.

## The Smaller Things

### Bad Thyme

> Replaces wood, most plants, vines, etc.

The most prominent type of flora, due to its incredible versatility.
It is completly unrelated to regular thyme.

![a diagram of a bad thyme stem](/ExternalAssets/ConceptArt/BadThymeDiagram.png)

Although it is confirmed that this is indeed a plant,
the skull-like flowers they grow can sometimes produce brains.
When this happens, the thyme gains sentience.

These so-called "Live Thymes" will then uproot themselves
and burrow into the Sansderground, where they become predators.

Common prey for Live Thymes include:

- Worms
- Mice
- Humans

### Petrified Growths

> Replaces cacti.

Vaguely similar in appearance to Bad Thyme,
but made of a strange calcified material.

It is unclear if they're alive,
but they have been observed to grow like plants on their own.

Studies suggest that right under The Wastes lies a massive,
plant-like organism that produces these growths as some kind of waste product.

### Gohst Sauce

> Replaces Bee Wax.

The Battery Acid produced by the many Spawners of [Toriel's House] will often
leak out and mix with the surrounding Wallpaper Mold, creating a substance
called "Gohst Sauce".

Different amounts of each ingredients create different "flavors", as they're
coloquially called. Each flavor has its own properties.
Certain concentrations, in large quantities, form the many "Gohsts" that plague
Toriel's House.
The right amount of Wallpaper Mold, however, can create a being known
as [MOTHERSPAWNER].

### SOULs

> Replaces ores, life crystals/fruits and crystals.

Lost SOULs that wander into _Sans Fanfic_ are attracted to their self-images,
that is, their selves from different AUs.

If too many SOULs conglomerate, they fuse and solidify into SOUL veins.

These can then be extracted and processed into common materials and alloys.

The (less frequent) human SOULs - affected by the surrounding sansnergies -
become lone heart-shaped crystals.

Not all ores are SOULs however: some are simply residue from the surrounding
Fauna/Flora, or are directly produced by the environment.

| Blue SOUL        | Life Fruit      | Crystalized human SOULs                |

### Titan Sanses

> **AKA:** Titan!Sanses, Titanic Sanses
>
> Replaces nothing.

Ancient, gigantic Sanses that once roamed the land.

They are now extinct, but you can still see their remains in certain places,
such as their gargantuan skeletons towering in the background, or their shed
dust covering the [Consanstrate] and The Wastes.

While the ancient sansthology (sans mythology) states that the Titan Sanses are
the direct children of the [ B I G   S A N S ] (which makes sense, considering
the size of the two) there is no proof for or against this, so their origins
remain a mystery.

Something is notable is that, in the [No San's Land], there is a notably large
amount of Titan Sanses, their remains are still shedding large amounts of dust.
