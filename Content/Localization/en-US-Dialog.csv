BartenderHelpText.Help_1,"First off-a, you need to get some-a artifacts from me. Those cost-a Luigium Coins!"
BartenderHelpText.Help_2,"Use the artifacts to place sentries and-a traps. That costs FP (flower points)"
BartenderHelpText.Help_3,"It's-a easy to attract the Mushroom Army! They're after us, which means we can bait them with-a something BRANDED."
BartenderHelpText.Help_4,"Luckly, I happen to sell Brandshrooms, which should do the trick! Just-a place it on a Stand (which I also sell)"
BartenderHelpText.Help_5,"Place the Stand in an open, flat area. Obstacles will make this harder!"
BartenderHelpText.Help_6,"Once the arena is-a done, place the Brandshroom on the Stand and watch the magic happen!"
BartenderHelpText.Help_7,"You can't let them win. If they go back to their base, the'll be able to tell the rest of the Army our location! In other words: We'd be in REALLY BIG trouble!"
BartenderHelpText.Help_8,"Defenses cost-a 10FP. The Brandshroom drops some-a when placed. Enemies also drop them when-a defeated."
BartenderHelpText.Help_9,"They-a come in waves. Yeah, that's it."
BartenderHelpText.Help_10,"If you win, the Branshroom will pay you in Luigium Coins for your services."
BartenderHelpText.Help_11,"After your first-a win, you'll be able to use the artifacts outside of the event for regular TP."

BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,"Great-a job fighting the Mushroom Army back there! But-a those aren't their strongest forces. Always-a wondered why people never use-a their strongest attack first."
BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier2,"The Mushroom Army keeps-a getting stronger. But-a I heard rumors that-a they're going to join-a forces with King Koopa, so I doubt-a we've seen the last-a of them."
BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier3,"Wow! Even the big bad Koopa himself can't-a stop you! If I wasn't branded and you weren't from Undertale, I'd-a bring you over to Luigi Fanfic some time-a."
BartenderSpecialText.BeforeDD2Tier1,"I fear that-a the Mushroom Army is preparing for an invasion. We should-s really do something about it..."
BartenderSpecialText.FirstHelp,"Ok. First off, take-a these Luigium Coins, on the rocks."
BartenderSpecialText.FirstMeeting,"Oh my God what is this hellscape!? Last I-a remember, I was running away from-a the cops for Timeout Corner crimes..."
BartenderSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Mama mia! This place-a is scarier than my mansion!"
BartenderSpecialText.Graveyard2,"This place is-a starting to smell like-a the Timeout Corner! Do you really want to think-a you're branded?"
BartenderSpecialText.Party_1,"Party time! I sure can't wait-a for friendships to end-a!"
BartenderSpecialText.Party_2,"Uuuuhhh, hold on... What capsules do you have?"
BartenderSpecialText.Rain1,"Doesn't rain much-a back in Luigi Fanfic. Mainly because-a it's in the Box Dimension."
BartenderSpecialText.Rain2,"I almost want to go in the rain-a, but I know that won't wipe away my-a branded-ness."
BartenderSpecialText.Storm1,"WAH! The lightning is too scary!"
BartenderSpecialText.Storm2,"Buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh buh..."
BartenderSpecialText.Windy1,"This wind-a reminds me of the time-a that I went flying on-a busy beetles..."
BartenderSpecialText.Windy2,"Hold on to your-a cap, friend-o! 'tis very windy today."
