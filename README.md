# ![Sans Fanfic: Terraria Adventure](.github/images/gh-logo.png)

Sans Fanfic: Terraria Adventure (SFTA) is a [_Terraria_] [Resource Pack] that
aims to change _**every single**_ asset in the game
to be themed around [_Sans Fanfic_].

That mainly includes the game's **13,594** images and,
to a lesser extent, **18,288** text entries.

- A new **major** release is made every thousand or so sprites.
- **Minor** releases mostly consist of minor edits and non-image assets.

In total, there will be at least 13 major releases,
judging by the total image count.

## ![icon](.github/images/icon-other.png) QnA

### "When will next update be out?"

thats a good question megaman

### "Where is the player model?"

While the actual `Player_*` sprites are complete,
most of the hair, armor, accessories, etc. are not.

Due to this, the visuals really clash.
So the player model will only be brought to the main pack
when most of its sprites are done.

Currently, the player model is in a separate Resource Pack.
But I'm not sure it'll be made public.
